# Problem Statement

When a client applies for a loan, there are four types of decisions that could be taken by the client/company):
Approved: The Company has approved loan Application
Cancelled: The client cancelled the application sometime during approval. Either the client changed her/his mind about the loan or in some cases due to a higher risk of the client he received worse pricing which he did not want.
Refused: The company had rejected the loan (because the client does not meet their requirements etc.).
Unused offer:  Loan has been cancelled by the client but on different stages of the process.

# Business Objectives 

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.

# Results Expected

Present the overall approach of the analysis in a presentation.
